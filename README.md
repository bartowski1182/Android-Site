Android-ROM-Site
============

This site will be used to host and display ROMs made by Android developers. It will feature organized views of all
available phones, and lists of all their available ROMs. Developers will be able to update descriptions and links
on the ROM's main page, as well as reply to community feedback. The community will be able to post comments and bug
reports. Bug reports will have a "voting system" with which other users can give the bug higher priority. Higher 
priority bugs will be ones that more users experience, and seeing the higher priority bugs will let the developers
know what they should be looking to fix sooner. There will  be three different permission levels; member, moderator,
and developer. Members will have permission to submit comments, submit bug reports, and vote on other bug reports. 
Moderators will be able to remove innapropriate comments, mark bugs as "fixed", organize anything on the site, and 
approve submitted ROMs or new phones to be added to the list. Developers will be allowed to edit their description 
of their ROM, post their own ROMs, mark bug reports as viewed, fixed, and also comment on them if they'd like to give
a more detailed analysis.
